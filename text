Here's a summary of the steps we've completed so far:

1. **Folder Structure & Basic Chatbot Setup:**  
   - Created a project folder with files such as `chatbot.php` for the chat interface and `process_chat.php` for handling user messages.
   - Set up supporting pages (e.g., `index.php`, `department.php`, etc.) and an assets folder for CSS, images, and PDFs.

2. **Database Integration:**  
   - Created a `db.php` file to establish a MySQL connection.
   - Defined the necessary database tables:


   


   CREATE TABLE college_info (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    question VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    answer TEXT NOT NULL
);


INSERT INTO college_info (question, answer) VALUES 
('courses offered', 'Vidyalankar Polytechnic offers diploma courses in Computer Engineering, IT, Electronics, and more.'),
('apply for admission', 'You can apply online through the official website or visit the admission office at Vidyalankar Polytechnic.'),
('college location', 'Vidyalankar Polytechnic is located in Mumbai, Maharashtra.');
